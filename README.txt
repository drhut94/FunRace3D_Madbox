-The time it took you to perform the exercise
4h 35min

-The parts that were difficult for you and why
The most dificult part was the camera movment. Normally I use something like cinemachine for controlling cameras, but in this project I decided to make it on my own.

The parts you think you could do better and how
I could probably improve player movement by enambling it to climb walls and slide downhill just by enabling player to follow waypoints vertically.
I could also improve UI by adding some options like a pause menu and a restart button and making it a little more "dynamic" by adding some effects and animations.
I could also improve feedback for example when the player dies or when it gets to the end of the level by adding some particles.

What you would do if you could go a step further on this game
I whould add more "movment" to the game. The game seems to static. To solve that I whould add breakable objects and some more ambient particles.
I also whould make a level editor. Althoug it may take some more time in order to program it whould enable to create levels much quicker without touching anithing of code. This way even people with low programming skills could create levels.

What did you think
I think I did most of the things I planned at the beggining. But maybe I focused to much on the core game mechanics, like movement and camera, and I didn't have much time to focus on creating more content like more traps.
But it was defenetifly a fun and challenging test that showed me what I was able to do in less than 5h.
